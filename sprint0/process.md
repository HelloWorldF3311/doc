Team organization
Member 1 (Aaron):
Roles: Project Manager, Lead Developer, Backend Developer
Responsibilities: Overseeing project timelines, managing server-side development, and ensuring code quality.
Member 2 (Haoyang Tian):
Roles: Frontend Developer, UX/UI Designer, QA Engineer
Responsibilities: Designing and implementing the user interface, enhancing user experience, and performing testing.
Tools Used:

Communication: We used Discord as our primary communication tool for instant messaging, voice calls, and screen sharing. It allowed us to have real-time conversations and collaborate effectively despite any physical distance.
Project Management: We basically talk everything via discord.
Version Control: GitHub served as our repository for code management, collaboration, and issue tracking.
Documentation: Shared documents and notes were maintained inside the coding .
Decision-Making Process
With a small team, our decision-making process was straightforward and collaborative:

Open Communication: We discussed all decisions openly on Discord, ensuring both team members had a chance to voice their opinions.
Consensus-Based Decisions: Given our team size, we aimed for unanimous agreement on key decisions.
Role Consideration: For decisions in specific domains (e.g., frontend design), the team member responsible for that area had the final say, but we still valued input from both perspectives.
Prioritizing User Stories

Process:

Listing User Stories: We compiled a list of user stories based on our project objectives and user needs.
Discussion: We reviewed each user story together, discussing its importance and feasibility.
Consensus on Priority: Since there were only two of us, we discussed until we reached an agreement on the priority of each story.
Effort Estimation: We roughly estimated the effort required for each story to help with scheduling and workload distribution.
Rounds of Discussion: Typically, we reached consensus within one discussion round per story.
Meeting Frequency
Daily Check-Ins:
When: Brief check-ins every day via Discord chat.
Purpose: Share what we worked on, plan for the day, and raise any immediate concerns.

Lessons Learned for the Next Phase
What Went Well:
Efficient Communication: Using Discord allowed us to communicate instantly and effectively, reducing delays.
Flexibility: With just two team members, we could quickly adapt to changes and make decisions swiftly.
Shared Responsibility: We both took ownership of the project's success, leading to high motivation and commitment.

Challenges:
Workload Management: Balancing multiple roles was challenging and sometimes led to longer working hours.
Skill Gaps: There were areas where neither of us had extensive expertise, which required extra time for learning.
Limited Perspectives: With only two viewpoints, we sometimes lacked the diversity of ideas a larger team might offer.
Action Items for Next Phase:

Action Items for Next Phase:
Time Management: Set more structured schedules to prevent burnout and ensure a sustainable pace.
Skill Development: Allocate time for learning and improving skills in weaker areas to increase efficiency.
Seek External Feedback: Involve friends or peers to get additional perspectives on our work, especially for design and usability.
